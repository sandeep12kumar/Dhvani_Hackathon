# Dhvani_Hackathon
This repository contains my completed solutions for the three tasks in the Dhvani hackathon. Each task's code and related documents are organized into separate folders.


## Task 1: Ring Defect Detection

**Problem Statement:** Create a general algorithm to detect and classify "Flashes" and "Cuts" in images of ring-shaped objects, robust to variations in diameter and position.

**Status:** Completed.


## Task 2: 3D Dynamical System Trajectory Plotting

**Problem Statement:** Plot the 3D trajectory of a dynamical system described by a set of three coupled differential equations.

**Status:** Completed.


## Task 3: Vehicle Object Detection
**Problem Statement:** Build an object detector and classifier to predict the type of vehicles (e.g., Cars, Buses, Motorbikes) from a provided image dataset with XML annotations.

**Status:** Completed.
